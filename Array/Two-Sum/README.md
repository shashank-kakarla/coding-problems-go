# Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers whose sum is equal to a given target or an empty array if no pair adds upto the target value. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 

## Example
### Input
``` 
array = [5,6,9,3,2,7]
target = 11
```
### Output
```
[9,2]
```

## Running the file
You must create a function which calls the function in the main package
```go
go run <FILENAME>
```
